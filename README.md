# Aqua-obfuscator
a lua obfuscator

requires lua 5.1 and nodejs to be installed


    Obfuscator written by me.
    Minifier was made by Stravant and rewritten in js by Herrtt.
    The VM is based on rerubi.



    TODO:
        - Compound operator support (not in lua 5.1).
        - continue support.
        - Type support (v: any).
        - XOR's to instruction data and other stuff.
        - Constant incription ?
        - Mutate more stuff ?
